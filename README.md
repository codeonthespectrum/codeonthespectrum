# Welcome! 👋
Hi! I'm Gabrielly, but you can call me **Kimi** 🧩  
I'm a **Machine Learning & AI Engineer** with 2 years of experience. I believe in human-centered tech that drives meaningful change where it matters most.

I'm a second-year Data Management student at the **Federal University of Piauí in Brazil**

# Welcome! 👋
Hi! I'm Gabrielly, but you can call me **Kimi** 🧩  
I'm an **ML Engineer focused on MLOps and AI Infrastructure** with 2 years of experience. I build **production AI systems that scale and cost less**.

## 🔧 Building in Public: Billink AI

I'm currently building **[Billink AI](https://billinkai.com)** — a SaaS platform that automates cloud and AI infrastructure cost auditing using multi-agent LLM pipelines. 

**What it does:**
- Analyzes billing data from AWS, OpenAI, and Anthropic
- Identifies waste patterns (idle GPUs, expensive model overuse, storage inefficiencies)
- Generates actionable recommendations with projected savings

**Roadmap:**
- ✅ Architecture designed (3-stage agent pipeline: Extractor → Analyst → Advisor)
- 🚧 MVP in development (CSV upload → analysis → PDF report)
- 🎯 Goal: 2 paying customers for validation

**Follow the journey:** I share progress, learnings, and challenges on [LinkedIn](https://br.linkedin.com/in/gabrielly-gomes-ml).
